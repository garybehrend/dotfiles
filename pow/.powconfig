#   .powconfig
#
# SYNOPSIS: The default system environment for web apps hosted by Pow.
#
# IMPORTANT(jeff): Changes made to this file will not be reflected until Pow
# has been restarted.
#
# IMPORTANT(jeff): Customize the local environment for the web app by
# provisioning an app-specific .powconfig in the root directory of the app.

#
#     ADDITIONAL NOTES
#   e1) The first time that the web application being hosted by pow is
# visited, the app is in "stand by" mode and must be cold booted. Once the
# initial request has received its response back to the end-user, it remains in
# an active process until the number of seconds specified has elapsed.
#
#   e2) This number controls the number of worker threads being executed
# in parallel. The number of threads should stay at or below the total number
# of logical cores available to a host. Tune upwards to improve site
# responsiveness when under load from multiple requests being made to it.
#
#   e3) The local environment to setup for Pow, i.e.: Ruby, Node.JS, PHP
# configuration.
