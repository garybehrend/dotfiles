I see you sitting at the bar
I wonder who the fuck you are

You undress me with your eyes
Dreaming 'bout my creamy thighs

Did you want to see my tits
Do you want to taste my lips

Take me home I'm feeling hot
Right here right now on the spot

Throw it down on the bar
Shall we do it in my car

You're so naughty I'm so nice
Maybe we should do it twice

I don't even know your name
You don't even know my name

I know you want to hear those screams
Cause your the one that's in my dreams

I see you sitting at the bar
I wonder who the fuck you are

You undress me with your eyes
Dreaming 'bout my creamy thighs

Did you want to see my tits
Do you want to taste my lips

Take me home I'm feeling hot
Right here right here on the spot

Throw me down on the bar
Shall we do it in my car

You're so naughty I'm so nice
Maybe we should do it twice

I will now then blow your mind
You don't even know my name

I know you want to hear those screams
Cause your the one that's in my dreams
